## What is it? 🧐  
This integration creates a dummy `device_tracker` entity with GPS coordinates based on your selected location.  

## But... why? 🤷🏻‍♂️  
The idea started when I was developing the [eSolatGPS](https://github.com/zubir2k/homeassistant-esolatgps), where I needed to test various GPS coordinates.  
The earlier version used AppDaemon, relying on the GPS from an `input_text` entity, which was limited to ONLY one location at a time.  

With this integration, you can create as many `device_tracker` entities as you want! 🎉  

There are many use cases where this can come in handy:  
1. Testing location-triggered automation  
2. Assigning a person entity to a permanent location  
3. Experimenting with GPS-based functionality  

## Wanna Give It a Try? 😉  
The usual drill—get `HACS` if you haven’t already. Then, head to the settings to add a repository.  
Otherwise, just click the button below:  

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=zubir2k&repository=homeassistant-dummytracker&category=integration)

Once installation is complete, restart your Home Assistant.  
- Next, go to `Settings > Devices & Services` and click `Add Integration`.  
- Look for `Dummy Device Tracker`.  
- Enter the GPS coordinates OR drag the pin to your desired location.  
- Give it a name and press `Submit` to save changes.  

Congrats! A new `device_tracker` entity has been created. 🎊  
(Well, don't forget you will still require to assign the `device_tracker` to a person entity 🙋🏻‍♂️)

## Tracking Animals Used in the Real World 🐾  
Various animals are commonly tracked for research, conservation, or other purposes:  
- **Homing Pigeons** 🐦 – Used for navigation and message delivery, guided by Earth's magnetic field.  
- **Hunting Dogs** 🐕 – Trained for tracking scents in hunting and search-and-rescue missions.  
- **Falcons** 🦅 – Sometimes equipped with GPS trackers to study flight patterns.  
- **Marine Animals** 🦈 – Sharks, sea turtles, and whales are tagged with GPS to monitor their movements.  
- **Big Cats** 🐆 – Cheetahs, leopards, and lions wear GPS collars for wildlife research.  
- **Bears & Wolves** 🐻🐺 – GPS collars help study their migration and habitat use.  

## And... just to be clear ⚠  
This dummy tracker is intended for simulation and testing. Any form of misuse or reliance on this tracker for real-world scenarios is strongly discouraged. The developers are not responsible for any consequences arising from incorrect use of this tool. Use it at your own risk. No known tracking animals were harmed during the making of this integration. 🐾
