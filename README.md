## What is it? üßê
This integration creates a dummy `device_tracker` entity with GPS coordinates based on your selected location.

## But.. why? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
The idea started when I was creating the Appdaemon eSolatGPS where I needed to test various GPS coordinates.
The earlier version uses Appdaemon where it relies the GPS from a `input_text` entity and was limited to ONLY 1 location at a time.

With this integration, you can create as many `device_tracker` as you want üéâ

There are many use cases that you can benefit from this.
1. Trying out location triggered automation
2. Wanted to assign a person entity to a permanent location
3. Testing 

## Wanna Give It a Try? üòâ
The normal drill, get `HACS` if you still haven't done that. Then head to the settings where you can add a repository. \
Otherwise, just click the button below:

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=zubir2k&repository=homeassistant-dummytracker&category=integration)

After installation completed, restart your Home Assistant
- Next, go to your `Settings > Devices & services` menu and click at the `Add Integration`
- Look for `Dummy Device Tracker`
- Enter the GPS coordinates OR drag the pin to your desired location.
- Give it a name and press `Submit` to save changes.

Congrats! a new `device_tracker` entity has been created.
